3.) Description of any known compile/runtime errors or bugs
a. According to Noah, "it works except collisions with certain stage platforms" such a way with words
b. This project was tested via XBOX One controllers. XBOX 360 controllers should work as well, but they were never used in development
c. Controllers were also hard wired via a USB cable. They were enver tested wirelessly and thus may not work
d. Characters can clip through hit boxes if they hit them while falling
	- This is an unfortuante side effect of how we made the hit boxes. We found this bug too late to fix :(
e. Characters can "glitch out" while on the Shrek blocks, but this is rare and non-replicable in a normal game
f. Some of the levels may load strangely since the aspect ratio of the Surfaces we were using to develop the game are different from most displays.
